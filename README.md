## Dependencies

The Wanderly Travel Blog has minimal dependencies, making it easy to manage. Here are the key dependencies:

- **HTML & CSS**: These are the core technologies used for creating the website's structure and styling. No specific frameworks or libraries are used.

- **IBM Cloud Object Storage**: The website is hosted using IBM Cloud Object Storage. You will need an IBM Cloud account and a configured instance of Object Storage to host the website.

- **Custom Domain (Optional)**: If you choose to use a custom domain name, you will need to manage domain registration and DNS settings with a domain registrar of your choice.

## Local Development

If you want to test changes locally before deploying, you can set up a local development environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine.

2. **Edit HTML & CSS**: Make your desired changes to the HTML and CSS files using a text editor or code editor of your choice.

3. **Preview**: To preview your changes, open the HTML files in a web browser. This will give you a sense of how your updates will look once deployed.

## Deployment

To deploy the Wanderly Travel Blog, follow these steps:

1. **IBM Cloud Object Storage**: Make sure you have an IBM Cloud account and have created an instance of IBM Cloud Object Storage.

2. **Buckets**: In IBM Cloud Object Storage, create buckets to store the website files. Upload the HTML, CSS, and image files to the relevant buckets.

3. **Public Access**: Ensure that the files in the buckets are set to be publicly accessible. This is essential for users to access your website.

4. **Domain & DNS (Optional)**: If you want to use a custom domain, configure your domain name with a domain registrar, and set up the DNS settings to point to your IBM Cloud Object Storage hosting.

5. **SSL Certificate (Optional)**: If you wish to secure your website, consider obtaining and configuring an SSL certificate.

6. **Testing**: Test your website thoroughly before the official launch. Ensure it works across different browsers and devices.

7. **Launch**: Once you are satisfied with your website's performance, it's ready for a public launch.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during website setup, content updates, or deployment, you can refer to the IBM Cloud documentation for guidance or seek assistance from your domain registrar if you're configuring a custom domain. Additionally, you can review the HTML and CSS code for any syntax errors or issues.
